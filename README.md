# Just another clich√© weather app

They say that you are not a web developer unless you have an open-source weather app on Github. Well, let them say!
<br />
<br />
introducing the all-new weather app! THE CLICHE WEATHER APP!!
<br />
<br />
It's just another weather app that nobody's gonna use, and there's nothing new here.. but hey! at least I can brag about my awesome skills.
<br />
<br />
So pack your swimsuits (or umberlla - depends on where you live) and check out this awesome web app (which is, again, just another useless one).
<br />
<br />
Wait 'till you see the way I fetched data from the server, bet you can't to that! And oh, the way I handled possible errors is on another level!
<br />
<br />
Okay so now when I'm offically a web developer, let me drop some BUZZWORDS like REACT, SASS and CUSTOM HOOKS, wohoo, feels awesome! You should try that too (only if you have an open-source weather app repo on Github)..
